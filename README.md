# f21sc-2021-22-CW2

A blank project with spec for CW2. Fork this repo to version-control your code (pair CW) and to ask questions through gitlab-student commit messages.

## Implement a Data Analysis tool for document tracking data in Python.

This coursework requires an implementation of a simple application in Python. Additionally, you must summarise the application in a report, following the structure specified in the assignment, and a screencast demonstrating its usage. Submit report, sources, stand-alone application, and screencast, all electronically, through Vision.

There are 2 versions of the CW spec, differing only in one section of the report. This is also reflected in the marking scheme. ***Make sure you pick up the version of the spec matching your course!***
